    <p>Let's take a deep dive into different species I have studied over time</p>
    
    <h4>Class Mammalia</h4>
    <p>Class Mammalia is a group of warm-blooded vertebrates defined by hair or fur and mammary glands that nourish their young. With advanced brains and lungs for breathing air, mammals inhabit nearly every environment on Earth and play essential roles in natural ecosystems.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lion (Panthera leo)</strong>: Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are social animals that live in prides. They are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.</li>

        <li><strong>Tiger (Panthera tigris)</strong>: The largest cat species, tigers are solitary and powerful predators. They are known for their distinctive orange coats with black stripes and are critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</li>

        <li><strong>Polar bear (Ursus maritimus)</strong>: The largest land animal, polar bears are adapted to life on sea ice. They are excellent swimmers and rely on the Arctic ice for hunting seals.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>These predators feed on a variety of prey depending on their habitats. In the Savanna the lion feasts on herds of buffaloes and zebras, in the forest the tiger hunts deer and other forest animals, and in the Arctic the polar bear hunts seals.</p>
